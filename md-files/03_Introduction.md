The ELEphanT-tool has been developed in the context of a practical scientific internship which is
obligatory in the master's program „Digitale Methodik in den Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften“
(Digital Humanities). At the same time, this project is embedded into the CHYLSA-project which is
an interdisciplinary project between the Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz (JGU) and the Freie
Universität Berlin (FU) (s. above). CHYLSA focuses on children’s and youth literature (CYL).

The presented student project equals some kind of a first feasibility study in terms of text
complexity in CYL. Concretely, the project focuses on the German language variety Easy Language
and aims at measuring the degree of Easy Language in a given text. The ELEphanT-tool was tested
mainly on CHYLSA-data (CYL-texts) because we are interested in figuring out dimensions of the
complexity / readability of children’s books. In terms of ELEphanT, our research hypothesis is to
investigate whether children’s books for younger children comply more to the rules of Easy
Language than books for older children. In addition, ELEphanT is used on a sample of Easy
Language texts. This evaluation is described below.

As Easy Language is intended for non-fiction books, this poses not only challenges in terms
of a different text genre but also new insights into the complexity of children’s literature with
respect to Easy Language. Please note that the test data can’t be shared due to legal restrictions.
