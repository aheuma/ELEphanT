Easy Language ("Leichte Sprache") is a German language variety distinguished by simplicity, a clear text formatting
and firm rules. In Germany, the influence of Easy Language increased strongly in the first decade of
2000 when the Federal Act on Equality for People with Disabilities (in 2002) was adopted, as well
as its realization, the [Accessible Information Technology Regulation]("http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bitv_2_0/BJNR184300011.html") (2011).

In a broader sense, Easy Language targets all people that canâ€™t deal properly with a standard
text and would prefer a more simple version. Concretely, this includes groups such as functional
illiterate people, people suffering from Dementia, hearing impaired people, foreign language
learners etc.

Although Easy Language has gained some public attention in the last few years, there
is no standard rulebook in Germany. Instead, there are multiple sets of rules, in most cases with
either a strongly scientific or practical-political background. 
\
In Germany, the most popular rulebook is the one by [Netzwerk Leichte Sprache]("https://www.leichte-sprache.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Regeln_Leichte_Sprache.pdf"). The rules are separated regarding different application levels: words, numbers and characters, sentences, texts, design and
pictures. Examples for rules are:
- Use short words
- Avoid questions in the text
- Use an easy writing font
