## Description
This student project is embedded in the DFG-funded project "CHYLSA – Advanced sentiment analysis for understanding affective-aesthetic responses to literary texts: A computational and experimental psychology approach to children’s literature" at Johannes Gutenberg-Universität (JGU) Mainz and Freie Universität Berlin and is part of the master program "Digitale Methodik in den Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften" (Digital Humanities) at the JGU. <br> It aims at analyzing a given text in terms of its compliance to a specific ruleset of Easy Language. This includes research regarding Easy Language theory, rulebooks and automatic text simplification. The chosen rulebook is then implemented in Python to develop a tool that measures the degree of Easy Language and returns an Easy Language score.

## Easy Language
Easy Language is a German language variety distinguished by simplicity, a clear text formating and firm rules. In Germany, the influence of Leichte Sprache increased strongly in the first decade of 2000 when the Federal Act on Equality for People with Disabilities (in 2002) and its realization, the "Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung" (BITV 2.0) (Accessible Information Technology Regulation) in 2011, were adopted. <br>
In a broader sense, Easy Language targets all people that can't deal properly with a standard text and would prefer a more simple version. Concretely, this includes groups such as functional illiterate people, people suffering from Dementia, hearing impaired people, foreign language learners etc. <br>
There is no standard rulebook for Easy Language. Instead, there are multiple rulebooks, in most cases with either a strongly scientific oder practical-political background. For this project, the rulebook by [Netzwerk Leichte Sprache](https://www.leichte-sprache.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Regeln_Leichte_Sprache.pdf) has been chosen, due to its popularity, among other things.

## Usage
- Refer to the [streamlit web application](https://aheuma-elephant-start-ysqsc4.streamlit.app/). <br>
- ELEphanT analyzes a single text. If you want to a) analyze multiple texts at once or b) run the tool via terminal, refer to the second repository on [GitLab](https://gitlab.rlp.net/aheumann/elephant).
